The novelty of our approach stems from the theory of hyperproperties. A hyperproperty is a set of sets of execution traces, expressing the property of a set of executions, rather then traditional trace-based languages that describe properties of individual executions. The inherent multi-trace nature of hyperproperties makes them a highly desirable framework to specify objectives and intended behaviors of controllable robots and uncontrollable adversaries in multi-agent systems. We specify several path planning problems in the temporal logic HyperLTL --- a generalization of the Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that allows for simultaneous and explicit quantification over execution traces. We show that HyperLTL can capture many important path planning requirements such as optimization, privacy, priority, and adversarial control policies. We reduce the path planning problem to the HyperLTL verification problem for bounded executions and utilize a solution based on solving the satisfiability problem for quantified Boolean formulas (QBF). Our experiments show %very encouraging results the applicability of our method in terms of generality and the diversity of path planning problems as well as efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-Agent Path Planning with Hyperproperties","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Wang","Mojtaba Zarei","Borzoo Bonakdarpour","Miroslav Pajic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604275200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604275200,"objectID":"8d8cdafef9f359c48a1e1ecda9dfbcf0","permalink":"https://shi-jingjing.github.io/publication/2021-iccps-conformance/","publishdate":"2020-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-iccps-conformance/","section":"publication","summary":"Conformance is a key concept in the analysis of cyber-physical systems (CPS). It indicates that two models simultaneously satisfy the same specifications of interest practically so that the result of analyzing one model automatically transfers to the other. In this paper, we propose a new concept of probabilistic conformance for CPS, extending previous study to the probabilistic domain. It is defined by the approximately equal satisfaction probabilities for a given parameterized signal temporal logic specification. Then we propose the first statistical verification method for probabilistic conformance of temporal logic specifications for grey-box CPS. To this end, we introduce a novel extended Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that can check approximately equal of two probability distributions for any desired confidence level (","tags":null,"title":"Probabilistic Conformance for Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563041163,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563041163,"objectID":"6d0b8f848b4e6da3cc05e8fec22d35a0","permalink":"https://shi-jingjing.github.io/project/smc/","publishdate":"2019-07-13T14:06:03-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/smc/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Statistical Model Checking","type":"project"}]
